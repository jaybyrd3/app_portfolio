        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hello! I'm Jimmy Byrd, a computer science student with a deep-rooted passion for programming.</p>
        <p>My tech journey commenced in the world of video games. At a young age, I immersed myself in the world of modded Minecraft, where I dabbled in the Lua programming language within the Minecraft mod ComputerCraft. This early exposure to coding ignited my curiosity.</p>
        <p>As life progressed, I found myself hosting Ark Survival servers and managing a vibrant community of over 12,000 members. The challenges of managing such a large community led me to teach myself Python, enabling me to programmatically interact with server host APIs. I developed a powerful Discord bot and began work on a web interface. It soon became apparent that programming had become my new passion, leading me to pursue higher education in computer science.</p>
        <p>Although I shifted my focus away from game server hosting, I continued to support and advise my friends who took over the Discord project I initiated. It has now grown to serve over 700,000 Discord users. You can find the project <a href="https://www.helenabot.com/contact-us">here</a>.</p>
        <p>Since then, I've honed my skills in various programming languages, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Python</li>
            <li>Java</li>
            <li>SQL</li>
            <li>HTML</li>
            <li>Swift</li>
            <li>C++</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I've had the privilege to work on several exciting projects, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Developing Discord bots and websites for managing Nitrado hosted game servers</li>
            <li>Creating this personal portfolio website</li>
            <li>Designing an electronic checkerboard game with AI opponents</li>
            <li>Making progress on a cross-platform social experiment app using Flutter</li>
            <li>Advancing a game project utilizing Unreal Engine 5</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Aside from my technical skills, I take pride in being a strong team player with exceptional problem-solving abilities.</p>
